# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project is an attempt to analyse the reasons for Customer Churn. This is a classification problem wherein a given customer profile is classified as a potential churn or a not churn. We have used down sampling to deal with class imbalance. The training data was fed to various machine learning algorithms to check the better performing one.
